# Install Coqui TTS
pip install TTS

# STEP 1: Load Coqui TTS Model (Offline)
from TTS.api import TTS

# Load a small, offline-capable English model
tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC", progress_bar=False, gpu=False)

# You can also try a multi-speaker model like:
tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/en/vctk/vits", progress_bar=False, gpu=False)

# STEP 2: Convert LLM Output to Audio

def speak_text(text, output_path="response.wav"):
    print("Synthesizing speech...")
    tts.tts_to_file(text=text, file_path=output_path)
    print(f"Audio saved to: {output_path}")


# STEP 3: Run End-to-End Pipeline

# Simulate a real conversation turn
asr_output = "Hi, my phone isn't connecting to WiFi even though other devices are working fine. What should I do?"

# Run through LLM
response_text = generate_response(asr_output, tokenizer, model)
print("LLM Response:", response_text)

# Speak it aloud
speak_text(response_text)

# We now have:
# Input speech (ASR from Whisper),
# LLM response (Gemma 3),
# Spoken reply (Coqui TTS as the voice).
