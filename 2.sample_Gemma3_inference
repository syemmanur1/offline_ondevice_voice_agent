pip install transformers accelerate sentencepiece

# STEP 1: Download & Quantize Gemma 3
# use transformers and AutoGPTQ for quantization. Gemma 3B (not 7B) is more practical for offline or edge inference.

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

# Use bfloat16 or 4-bit for quantized inference
model_name = "google/gemma-1.1-2b-it"

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_fast=True)

# Quantized model (4-bit) loading using bitsandbytes
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",  # Normal float 4
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)

# Load quantized model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    device_map="auto",  # 'cuda' or 'cpu' fallback
    quantization_config=bnb_config
)

model.eval()

# This loads a 4-bit quantized version of Gemma 2B-IT using bitsandbytes. It's way lighter for CPU or GPU inference.

## STEP 2: Simulate Input from Whisper ASR

# We'll use a sample customer query as if it came from Whisper:
# Example ASR output
customer_query = "Hi, my phone isn't connecting to WiFi even though other devices are working fine. What should I do?"

#You can plug this directly into your pipeline from the previous ASR step.

# STEP 3: Prompt Engineering for vz-specific LLM

def build_prompt(customer_query):
    """
    Create a vz-tuned instruction prompt for Gemma.
    """
    system_prompt = (
        "You are a helpful vz assistant that answers customer questions "
        "about device settings, connectivity, troubleshooting, eSIM, and usage tips."
    )

    full_prompt = f"<start_of_turn>user\n{customer_query}<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n"
    return system_prompt + "\n\n" + full_prompt


# STEP 4: Generate the Response

def generate_response(query, tokenizer, model, max_tokens=256):
    prompt = build_prompt(query)

    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model.generate(
            **inputs,
            max_new_tokens=max_tokens,
            do_sample=True,
            temperature=0.7,
            top_p=0.95,
            repetition_penalty=1.1,
            pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
        )

    response = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response.split("<start_of_turn>model")[-1].strip()


STEP 5: Run It

response = generate_response(customer_query, tokenizer, model)
print("Gemma's Response:\n", response)

# Sample Output

Gemma's Response:
Sure! Let's troubleshoot your WiFi issue.

1. First, go to Settings > WiFi and forget the current network.
2. Reboot your phone.
3. Turn WiFi back on and reconnect to the network.
4. If that fails, try resetting network settings under Settings > System > Reset > Reset Network Settings.

Still not working? You may also try switching between 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands if your router supports it.
